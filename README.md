# docker-rpi-arduino

Arduino development environment for Docker in raspberry pi

A complete Arduino development environment for your builds inside docker. A good choice if you need to run arduino builds in your CI (Gitlab for example).

# Usage

Just clone this repo, and source functions.sh, and you will have all functions that you need to run your environment. Some functions will be added to your current bash environment, they are:

    arduino-init - Initializes a new arduino project in your current directory, do the entire bootstrap process (including a Gitlab CI configuration)
    arduino-build - Executes your build and generate your binary firmware
    arduino-upload - Considering that your arduino is mapped to /dev/ttyUSB0, it will upload your code to your board
    arduino-watch - Considering that your arduino is mapped to /dev/ttyUSB0, it will monitor it's serial output and show in your console
